# Posit Multiplier

During my internship for University of Washington's SAMPL Researh Group, I wrote a multiplier for numbers in the Posit format (an alternative to floating point). It was based off existing Verilog, but written in the Chisel language. Chisel is a hardware description language used to generate synthesizable Verilog. The Multiplier can be viewed at [https://github.com/uwsampl/vta-posit/tree/master/pynq-multiplier](https://github.com/uwsampl/vta-posit/tree/master/pynq-multiplier)

Included here is a short presentation I did, which covers the basics of the multiplier I wrote, the Chisel language, and the Posit number format.
